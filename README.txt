Object-oriented and Context-oriented programming in Lua
======================================================

CONTENT
=======
	The files:
		demo_oo.lua
		demo_cop.lua
		demo_cop_syntax_extension.mlua
	
	contain simple demonstrations of our implemented features.
	
	test_oo.lua and test_cop.mlua contain additional demonstrations (our internal test files used for development)
	
	The implementation is contained in the oo and cop folders (note: oo.lua also contains some code needed for COP)
	
	simpleoo contains a very simple implementation of object-orientation with only single inheritance and no COP.

REQUIREMENTS
============
	In order to run the demos, the Lua 5.1 binaries are required. You can get the latest source code from http://www.lua.org/download.html. For the *.mlua files also Metalua is required - http://metalua.luaforge.net.Optionally a complete package for Windows is available from http://luaforwindows.luaforge.net/. It also includes Metalua and an IDE that is configured for Lua (SciTE).
